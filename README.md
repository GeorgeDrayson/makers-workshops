**COINFLIP**
```
As a person
So I can have fun
I want to be able to flip a coin and find out if it came up heads or tails

As a person
So I can keep score
I want to be able to find out how many times the coin comes up heads

As a person
So I can remember my best score
I want to be able to print out my score
```
